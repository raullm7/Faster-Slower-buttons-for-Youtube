# Faster-Slower-buttons-for-Youtube
Script which uses the Tampermonkey extension to add faster and slower buttons to Youtube videos below the subscribe button.
The `faster` button increases the speed of video by 10% and the `slower` one (you guessed it) decreases it by 10%.

# To use it:
- Install Tampermonkey extension (I use it in Google Chrome).
- Go `Create new script`.
- Copy paste the script (`main.js`).
- Reload youtube and you should see two buttons below the `Subscribe` button.
- Feel free to modify anything you want in the code :).
- Enjoy!
